# Android Tests

#### Stories app
Created a stories app for testing some design patterns, libraries and Android SDK features described in the official Google [documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/). For the best results, if you try building your own app, just read the "Core topics" section before diving in. In this project we designed the Android app so that it respects the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) design pattern. You can read more about two architectural design patterns [here](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidArchitecture/article.html). For communicating with the REST API we used [Retrofit2](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library which is a REST client for Android.

We also created a REST server using the Spring Boot 2.3.2 framework, Spring Boot Rest services and Spring Data Jpa(Hibernate ORM) for communicating to a MySQL database.
